I would really like to find a new direction of my life.  
At the present moment i am working in electric industry as an engineer.  
Unfortunately, many workers of my professional area will be replaced with programs.  
I think that future will belong to IT industry. I am always interested in new science and other discoveries.   
I would really like to become a programmer because it is always something new.  

I have skill of programming language VB as an junior.  
For example,  
```
Sub f()
Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Count
Cells(1, i).Value = Worksheets(i).Name
Next i
End Sub
```
