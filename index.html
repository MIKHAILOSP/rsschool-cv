I would really like to find a new direction of my life.
At the present moment i am working in electric industry as an engineer.  
Unfortunately, many workers of my professional area will be replaced with programs.  
I think that future will belong to IT industry. I am always interested in new science and other discoveries.   
I would really like to become a programmer because it is always something new.

 Dim i As Integer
 For i = 1 To ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Count

 Next i
End Sub
